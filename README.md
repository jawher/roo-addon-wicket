Roo Wicket Addon
=======================

An Spring Roo addon that generates a Wicket-based view layer

# Important notice

This project is **abandoned**.
I was playing with Roo and thought it would be a good idea to implement Wicket views generation.
I've moved on to other things since then, and stopped working on this project.
I might even delete this repo on day.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

    $ mvn --version
    Apache Maven 3.0-beta-1 (r935667; 2010-04-19 19:00:39+0200)
    Java version: 1.6.0_20
